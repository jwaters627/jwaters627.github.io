                <p>This project was a 12 hour idea hack run through StartUp Institute.  We had a group of six people working to help generate more traffic and specifically traffic that translates to purchases for the Boston Public Market.  We designed a plan to increase their social media presence and myself and another designer worked specifically on improving their website.  We found that the market had an extremely high bounce rate and we attributed this to the chaotic feel of the landing page that is cluttered with tweets and does not immediately convey what the market is and what it is all about.</p>

                <p>We used sketch and invision to create a prototype of an improved landing page and a couple of subpages including the map of vendors.  We emphasized the local vendors and tried to keep the social media calls to action central.  We researched other market sites to see what competition was doing and below is the mockup of what we thought would help capture the attention of visitors to the site and improve their bounce rate and get people excited about the market.
