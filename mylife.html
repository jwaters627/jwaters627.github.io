                <p>The MyLife team was looking to do a redesign for their existing website.  The site was outdated and they were about to launch a kickstarter campaign for their new hip pack.  I worked with the owners of the company to help design the new site using squarespace, so the site coule be easily maintained and updated.  The brand emphasizes living life to the fullest and enjoying the places in life that mean the most to you.  The site needed to reflect this and showcase the hip pack.</p>
