                <p>Where in the World is a website that asks users to click through a series of questions to figure out some interests and then compares their answers to trips and returns trips that match their interests.  Christina Weich and I worked together through Github to create this site.  We used bootstrap for its grid system, wrote custom javascript to make it interactive and used some Angular JS to present the trips at the end.  The site is not completed, but please view our code on Github <a href= "https://github.com/jwaters627/Where-World"> HERE</a> </p>
