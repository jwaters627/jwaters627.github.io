	<p> My name is Jamie Waters and I am starting to learn web design.  My goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of html, css, java and any other languages required to develop beautifully designed websites that are very user friendly.  I am pretty new to these languages, but am about to start a program at Startup Institute to learn as much as possible over the next two months.  My background does not involve computer science or programming, but I have a degree in Physics and believe that the analytical tendencies developed will be an asset in coding.  I taught for four years after college and then moved to San Francisco for a year to pursue other opportunities.  After moving back to New England I have been searching for the right career path and believe that web design is something that will click with me and lead me to a fulfilling and successful career.  I cannot wait to get started. </p>
